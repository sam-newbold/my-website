## How to use this prompt

1. **Collect your inputs**  
* **\{URL\}** – the article, blog post, or landing page to promote.  
* **\{PLATFORM\}** – `"LinkedIn"` for a slightly longer professional tone or `"X"` for a punchier style.  
* **\{CHAR_LIMIT\}** – `280` for X, `600` for LinkedIn (or your own limit).  
* **\{BRAND_VOICE\}** – a quick descriptor such as `"friendly and data-driven"`.

2. **Paste the prompt into ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini**  
   Replace the placeholders with real values. Example:

   ```text
   URL: https://example.com/blog/customer‑journey‑ai
   PLATFORM: LinkedIn
   CHAR_LIMIT: 550
   BRAND_VOICE: friendly but authoritative
   ```

3. **Review & tweak**  
   Check the draft for compliance, hashtags, and any jargon. Tweak the hook or CTA to fit your brand nuance.

4. **Publish & measure**  
   Post, then track click‑through rate (CTR) and engagement. Feed the best‑performing variants back into your AI prompt history to create a virtuous loop.

### Pro tips

- **Create variations** by running the prompt twice with different tone descriptors (“playful”, “provocative”, “minimal”).  
- **Batch mode**: supply a list of URLs in a single conversation, instructing the model to output each post on a new line.  
- **UTM tags**: ask the model to append a UTM‑coded URL for campaign tracking.
